# RedditKit

RedditKit is a [reddit API](http://www.reddit.com/dev/api) wrapper, written in Objective-C.  This fork has more of a focus on OAuth support than the master repo.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

Add this to your Podfile:

    pod 'RedditKit', :git => "git@github.com:pyro2927/RedditKit.git", :branch => "master"

Then run:
	
    pod install

### Manually

1. Add RedditKit as a git submodule of your project.
2. Install its dependencies with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Drag and drop RedditKit and its dependencies into your project, and you're done!

## Getting Started

RedditKit is structured around the `RKClient` class. This class manages authentication for a single reddit account and performs HTTP requests on that user's behalf. `RKClient` can be used as a singleton with its `sharedClient` class method, or as a standalone object.

```obj-c
[[RKClient sharedClient] signInWithUsername:@"name" password:@"password" completion:^(NSError *error) {
    if (!error)
    {
        NSLog(@"Successfully signed in!");
    }
}];
```

Once you're signed in, `RKClient` will keep track of any necessary authentication state. You can then call methods which require authentication, such as getting the subreddits you are subscribed to.

**Note:** RedditKit does not persist your authentication credentials itself; you'll have to do this manually via the Keychain, and call `signInWithUsername:password:completion:` on your application's launch.

```obj-c
[[RKClient sharedClient] subscribedSubredditsWithCompletion:^(NSArray *subreddits, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"Subreddits: %@", subreddits);
}];
```

Retrieving the current top links in a subreddit is simple.

```obj-c
RKSubreddit *subreddit = [[self subreddits] firstObject];

[[RKClient sharedClient] linksInSubreddit:subreddit pagination:nil completion:^(NSArray *links, RKPagination *pagination, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"Links: %@", links);
}];
```

You can then upvote a link.

```obj-c
RKLink *link = [[self links] firstObject];

[[RKClient sharedClient] upvote:link completion:^(NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"Upvoted the link!");
}];
```

> RedditKit doesn't have any built-in rate limiting. reddit's API rules require that you make no more than 30 requests per minute and try to avoid requesting the same page more than once every 30 seconds. You can read up on the API rules [on their wiki page](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API).

## More Examples

**Get the top comments for a link:**

```obj-c
RKLink *link = [[self links] firstObject];

RKPagination *pagination = [RKPagination paginationWithLimit:100];
pagination.commentSortingMethod = RKCommentSortingMethodTop;

[[RKClient sharedClient] commentsForLink:link pagination:pagination completion:^(NSArray *comments, NSError *error) {
	if (comments)
	{
		NSLog(@"Comments: %@", comments);
	}
}];
```

**Fetch a user's account:**

```obj-c
[[RKClient sharedClient] userWithUsername:@"name" completion:^(RKUser *account, NSError *error) {
	if (account)
	{
		NSLog(@"%@", account);
	}
}];
```

**Send private messages:**

```obj-c
[[RKClient sharedClient] sendMessage:@"Hello!" subject:nil recipient:@"samsymons" completion:nil];
```

**Canceling a request:**

Each of RedditKit's methods return a `NSURLSessionDataTask`, which can be used to cancel a request before it has completed.

```obj-c
NSURLSessionDataTask *task = [[RKClient sharedClient] frontPageLinksWithCompletion:nil];
[task cancel];
```

## Pagination

Methods which are paginated can accept `RKPagination` objects.

`RKPagination` lets you change the sorting of returned objects. For example, when fetching the top 25 links in a subreddit, setting the `subredditCategory` property changes whether you get the top 25 links right now or the top links overall.

In addition to letting you change the pagination of your requests, RedditKit also gives you pagination information for any requests made. A request for links in a subreddit has a pagination object as an argument in its completion block.

> The [example project](Example/) implements pagination in a table view controller, loading new links when the user scrolls to the bottom.

## Multiple Accounts

`RKClient` manages a single reddit account. When supporting multiple accounts, all you need to do is switch from using the `sharedClient` method to using one `RKClient` instance per account.

For example, this code:

```obj-c
[[RKClient sharedClient] signInWithUsername:@"username" password:@"password" completion:nil];
[[RKClient sharedClient] upvote:someLink completion:nil];
```

Becomes this:

```obj-c
RKClient *client = [[RKClient alloc] init];

[client signInWithUsername:@"username" password:@"password" completion:nil];
[client upvote:someLink completion:nil];
```

How you manage the various `RKClient` instances is up to you. Probably with an `NSDictionary`, using reddit usernames as keys.

## Configuration

You can configure various aspects of RedditKit's operation, including its default API endpoint and user agent. Check out the `RKClient` header file for more.

**You should set your user agent to the name and version of your app, along with your reddit username. That way, if you ever have a buggy version of your app in the wild, the reddit admins will know who to contact.**

If you do not set one manually, the user agent will be provided by [AFNetworking](AFNetworking).

## Requirements

RedditKit requires either iOS 7.0+ or Mac OS X 10.9+. Xcode 5 is required in order to run its test suite.

ARC is required. For projects that don't use ARC, you can set the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag on the RedditKit source files.
